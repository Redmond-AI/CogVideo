Project Overview

This project aims to fine-tune the CogVideoX 2b generative AI video model to perform inpainting tasks on image sequences. Inpainting involves filling in missing or masked regions in images or videos, ensuring the reconstructed areas are visually coherent with the surrounding content. Instead of modifying the existing train_cogvideox_lora.py script directly, we will create a series of new scripts in the "inpainting" folder that leverage the code from this script and the rest of the repository. These new scripts will work together to train a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model specifically adapted for inpainting tasks.

Our dataset consists of RGB image sequences, corresponding mask sequences that indicate the regions to be inpainted, and ground truth (GT) image sequences for calculating the loss during training. Each sequence contains 100 frames at a resolution of 640x480 pixels. The approach involves systematically developing and testing each new script component, adapting them to handle our inpainting dataset effectively. By reusing and building upon the existing codebase, we aim to adjust data loading mechanisms, modify model inputs, and redefine loss functions as needed for inpainting. This methodical process ensures that we maintain the integrity of the original code while extending its capabilities to suit our specific task.

Final Remarks:

By following this step-by-step plan, you’ll systematically modify and test each part of the training script, ensuring that it works correctly for your inpainting task before moving on to the next section. This approach minimizes the risk of errors compounding across sections and helps maintain a clear understanding of each component’s functionality.
